#But test perparation course had significant impact on female students as only few female students got lower grades

#Male students achieved more A grades when they completed test preparation course unlike female students where there 
#was no impact on higher grades
#Similar to females, male students who completed test preparation course have significantly less number of lower grades than
# those without.
